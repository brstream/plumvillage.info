Dharma Sharing
##############

:author: Sr. Chân Đức

Dharma sharing is an opportunity for us to learn from each other by speaking and listening in the circle about our own personal experience. It is not an intellectual discussion or debate.

We make a simple gesture to request to speak and the same gesture when we have finished speaking. That gesture is usually joining the palms. Joining the palms means connecting ourselves to ourselves and to the whole group. If we prefer to make another gesture such as laying our hand on our heart then we may make that gesture.

We speak about our own experience, e.g. How we felt inspired by the morning’s Dharma talk, what we have not yet understood from the talk……, how the retreat is going for us, joys or difficulties that we have encountered here and in our practice at home and at work.

We do not want to react to, deny or negate what someone has just shared nor do we want to give advice to another unless they have asked for it. When listening to someone sharing we follow our breathing and when they have finished everyone breathes in and out three times before the next person requests  to speak. We never interrupt someone before they have shown that they have finished speaking.

We do not want to debate, argue or prove our point. We just want to complement what another has said by recounting our own experience.

We want to share with the whole group, so we do not direct our words or our question to one person but to the whole group. If we ask a question and no one addresses it, we wait until nearing the end of the session when the facilitator will address it.

Some of our sharings are very personal and deep so we practice confidentiality, not sharing outside of the group what we have heard within the group sharing.
Nor do we come to the person who has shared later on and expect her to share further on a one-to-one basis, without asking her if she is ready to do that first.
