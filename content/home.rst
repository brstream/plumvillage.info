Please enjoy your breathing.

This site is intended to be simple and clear: an online repository of texts from the Plum Village tradition. Eventually we would like to have it include translations of the main texts into every language imaginable.

If you have a question or idea, please email us directly at text (at) plumvillage (dot) org.
