Please enjoy your breathing.

This is the GitHub repository for a the http://plumvillage.info site, intended to be an online repository of texts from the Plum Village tradition. Eventually we would like to have it include translations of the main texts into every language imaginable.

If you have a question or idea, please email us directly at text (at) plumvillage (dot) org.
