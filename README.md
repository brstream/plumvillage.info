## Please enjoy your breathing.

This is the GitHub repository for a the http://plumvillage.info site, intended to be an online repository of texts from the Plum Village tradition. Eventually we would like to have it include **translations** of the main texts into every language imaginable, like:

- Spanish
- Italian
- Chinese



If you have a _question or idea_, please email us directly at text (at) plumvillage (dot) org.
